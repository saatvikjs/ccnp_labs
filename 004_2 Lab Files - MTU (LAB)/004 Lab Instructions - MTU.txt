# IP Info #
- R1-ISP: 203.0.111.0/24 (ISP = .100, R1 = .1)
- R2-ISP: 203.0.112.0/24 (ISP = .100, R2 = .2)
- R2-R3: 192.168.23.0/24 (R2 = .2, R3 = .3)

# Lab Instructions #
1) Do an extended ping from R1 to R2.
- Set the DF-bit
- Do a sweep of sizes from 1496 bytes to 1505 bytes.
- Which pings succeed? Which fail?
2) Configure a GRE tunnel between R1 and R2.
- Subnet: 192.168.12.0/30 (R1 = .1, R2 = .2)
- What is the IP MTU of the tunnel interface?
3) Configure the IP MTU of each router's tunnel interface to 1500.
- Ping R2's tunnel interface from R1, size 1500, no DF-bit.
- Ping R2's tunnel interface from R1, size 1500, set DF-bit.
- Verify that R1's pings were fragmented.
- Return the IP MTU to the default.
4) Send the following pings and troubleshoot the problem:
- Ping from R1 to R3, size 1476, set DF-bit
- Ping from R1 to R3, size 1476, no DF-bit
- What is preventing these pings from succeeding? Troubleshoot and fix the problem.
