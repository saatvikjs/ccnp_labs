    # IP Info #
    - Subnet 1: 192.168.1.0/24
    - R1 G0/0: 192.168.1.1/24
    - SW1 VLAN1: 192.168.1.2/24
    - SRV1: 192.168.1.11/24
    - SRV2: 192.168.1.12/24
    - SRV3: 192.168.1.13/24

    # Lab Instructions #
    1) Configure SRV1, SRV2, and SRV3 with the appropriate hostname, IP address, and default gateway.
        *the info for the Server node in the 'ADD NODES' tab lists the necessary commands.
    2) Start a packet capture on the link between R1 and SW1.
        *I recommend increasing the Max Packets from the default of 50.
    3) Use R1 to generate unicast and broadcast traffic in the network.
    4) Generate some unknown unicast traffic in the network. How will this traffic look (compared to the known unicast traffic) in the packet capture?
    5) Examine the packet capture and identify unicast, broadcast, and multicast messages.
        *In CML, messages in the packet capture only display when you are viewing the link's 'PACKET CAPTURE' tab. I recommend downloading the packet capture and viewing it in Wireshark.
    6) Disable MAC address aging on SW1.
    7) Statically configure R1's MAC address on SW1.
