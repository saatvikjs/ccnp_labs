# Lab Instructions #
1) Debug process-switched packets on R1. Send pings between R1, PC1, and PC2. Which pings produce debug output?
- Configure R1 so that it displays output for all ping messages.
- Disable the debug.
2) Enable a detailed debug of process-switched ICMP packets from PC1 to PC2 only (not PC2 to PC1 or any messages to/from R1).
- Confirm with a ping between PC1 and PC2.
- Disable the debug.
3) Enable OSPF on R1, R2, and R3. R1 won't be able to reach a FULL adjacency with R2 or R3.
- Use 'debug' commands only to troubleshoot and then fix the configurations.
- Set debug conditions to limit debug output and only troubleshoot one connection at a time (R2, then R3).
- Note: 'debug ip ospf adj' alone won't be sufficient.
- Remove all debugs and conditions after you have fixed the issues.
