# IP Info #
- Subnets are 192.168.XX.0/24 (XX = router numbers)
- IP addresses are .X (X = router number)

# Lab Instructions #
1) Debug ARP messages on R1 & R2 .
- Additional configurations are needed to display debug messages via the console connection

2) Initiate a packet capture on the R1-R2 link .
- I recommend increasing the Max Packets count over 50

3) Configure two static routes on R1:
- A recursive route to 192.168.23.0/24
- A directly-connected route to 192.168.34.0/24

4) Ping R2's G0/0 interface from R1.
- Is there any new ARP debug output?

5) Ping R3's G0/0 interface from R1.
- Does R1 send an ARP request? Why or why not?

6) Ping R4's G0/0 interface from R1.
- Why does the ping fail?
- Fix the issue and ping again
7) Examine R1's ARP table.

8) Change the ARP timeout of R1's G0/0 interface to 3 minutes.
- After how much time will R1 attempt to refresh R2's ARP entry?

9) Use Wireshark to examine each ARP exchange in the packet capture.
