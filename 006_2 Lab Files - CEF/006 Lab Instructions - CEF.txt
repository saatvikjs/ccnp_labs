# IP Info #
- Subnets are 192.168.XX.0/24 (R1-R2 segment is 192.168.12.0/24, R1-R3 segment is 192.168.13.0/24, etc.)
- IP addresses are .X (R1 IPs are .1, R2 IPs are .2, etc.)

# Lab Instructions #
1) In the list of processes running on R1's CPU, identify the process responsible for process switching packets.
2) Examine the RIB of R1.
3) Examine the FIB of R1 and compare it to the contents of the RIB.
- What entries are present in the FIB but not the RIB?
4) Examine the ARP table of R1.
5) Examine the Adjacency table of R1 and compare to the contents of the ARP table.
- Is neighbor resolution optimization enabled? What effect does this have on CEF?
6) Configure R1's interface to perform CEF load-balancing on a per-packet basis.
7) What is the default CEF load-balancing algorithm? What other options are there?
