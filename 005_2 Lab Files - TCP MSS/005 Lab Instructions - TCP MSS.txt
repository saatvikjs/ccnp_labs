# Lab Instructions #
1) Initiate a TCP connection (SSH) from R1 Tunnel0 to R2 Tunnel0.
- R1/R2 login is jeremy/ccnp
- R1/R2 enable secret is ccnp
- Use a debug command to verify the MSS for the connection
- Use a 'show' command to verify the MSS for the connection
- Why is the MSS neither the default of 536 (for remote connections) or 1460 (for local connections)?
2) Configure the MSS for TCP connections to/from R2 to use an MSS of 1400.
3) Initiate a TCP connection (SSH) from R1 Tunnel0 to R2 Tunnel0.
- Use a debug command to verify the MSS for the connection
- Use a 'show' command to verify the MSS for the connection
4) Initiate a TCP connection (SSH) from SRV1 to SRV2
- Use a packet capture on the SRV1-R1 link to verify the MSS for the connection.
- What message does R1 send to SRV1?
5) Terminate the previous TCP connection from SRV1 to SRV2 and initiate a new one.
- Use a packet capture on the SRV1-R1 link  to verify the MSS for the connection.
6) Disable ICMP Unreachable messages on R1 G0/1
7) Shutdown and power-on SRV1 and SRV2 to clear their caches
8) Initiate a TCP connection (SSH) from SRV1 to SRV2
- Use a packet capture on the SRV1-R1 link  to verify why SSH doesn't work this time.
9) Configure R1's Tunnel0 interface to adjust MSS values to an appropriate size
10) Initiate a TCP connection (SSH) from SRV1 to SRV2
- Use a debug on R1 to verify that it adjusted the MSS values.
